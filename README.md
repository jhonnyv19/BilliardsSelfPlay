# BilliardsSelfPlay
A personal project of mine using Unity ML Agents to see if I can train an RL agent to learn to play pool through self play, still currently working on this. 

Thankfully I was able to focus most of my time on the agents instead of a model of a pool table and billiards balls, which I was able to get thanks to Nick's project [here](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PoolSet-Unity.git)
